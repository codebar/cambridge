# Workshops

## Organisation

- Arrange event dates with the host and create a new workshop on the website (_Menu > New workshop_) for each, making sure the _Invitable_ checkbox is **unticked**
- Around ten days before the event, edit the workshop to make it _Invitable_ and send invitations to everyone
- Keep track of RSVPs to see if the ratio of students to coaches is right, and promote the workshop as needed on Twitter/Slack
- On the morning of the event (~8am), send the [custom email reminder][email-reminder] to all attendees
- On the afternoon of the event (~3pm), send the list of attendees and any dietary requirements to the host

### Remarks

- We don't allow RSVPs until around ten days before the event because otherwise we end up with a lot more dropouts (probably because people forget they've signed up until they get the automatic email reminder)
- We should aim to have workshops booked at least a couple of months in advance, so that we have time to look for alternative hosts if needed
- Students tend to drop out more than coaches, so we should aim for a 1:2 ratio before the automatic email reminder gets sent (two days before the event) and a 2:3 ratio before we confirm numbers with the host (at ~3pm on the day of the event)

## Facilitation

- Print the list of attendees and bring it with you, along with nametags, sharpies and codebar stickers
- Arrive at least fifteen minutes before the event starts
- Make yourself a nametag with your preferred pronouns
- Sign in attendees when they arrive and encourage them to make themselves a nametag
  - If they're new students, confirm that they've brought a [working laptop][working-laptop]
  - If they're new coaches, ask if they've read the [coach guide][coach-guide]
- Ask any students who've picked **I don't know, I'm a complete beginner** or **Other** for clarification
- [Pair students and coaches][pairing] based on what the students want to learn and what the coaches can teach
- Get everyone's attention, indicate toilets and fire exits, thank the hosts and announce the pairs
- After the event, verify everyone's attendance on the website

### Remarks

- You can tell someone is attending for the first time if there's an `I` next to their name
