# codebar today at {{host.name}}

Hi,

I’m looking forward to seeing you at the codebar workshop today ({{date}}) at 6:30 pm.

**Please let me know if you're no longer able to make it**, so someone else can have your spot. We also ask this because we organise to have the right ratio of coaches to students.

The event will be hosted by **{{host.name}}**, located at [{{{host.address}}}]({{host.map}}). {{{host.instructions}}}.

There will be food and drinks available, courtesy of our hosts. Please let me know if you have any dietary requirements, and we’ll try our best to accommodate you.

**If you're coming for the first time**, make sure to read our [code of conduct][coc] (new coaches should also read the [coach guide][coach-guide]).

**If you're a student**, please bring a [working laptop][setup]. You'll be paired with a coach based on what you want to learn (if you're looking for inspiration, check out our [tutorials]).
