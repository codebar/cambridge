# Pairing

An important part of organising a workshop is the pairing process. It ensures students are assigned to coaches that have the right skills to help them, but it also prevents first-time students from being assigned to first-time coaches.

## Manually

From the workshop page on the admin website, click _Attendees_. You'll get a printable page which should look like this:

```plain
